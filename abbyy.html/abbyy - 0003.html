<p>Editorial</p>
<p>Do we live in an accumulated city, the collected memory of all the cities we have known?</p>
<p>-Tadta Dean and Jeremy Millar</p>
<p>As we write this editorial thousands of new inhabitants will reside in cities such as Manila,&nbsp;Delhi, London and New York. Some of them are&nbsp;newborn babies, but many are new settlers&nbsp;seeing the city for the first time; a city whose&nbsp;structures, buildings and streets are unfamiliar&nbsp;to them. But maybe even for those who consider&nbsp;cities their homes, they still harbour something&nbsp;ungraspable.</p>
<p>As dominant discourses focus on issues of globalization and growing metropoles we want&nbsp;to stop for a moment and reflect on urban transformation. Cities confront us with our own hopes&nbsp;and dreams of what they might and should be.&nbsp;They pose new experiences of both social interaction and alienation. But they also confront us&nbsp;with material changes, which are often imposed&nbsp;by governments, but just as well can be a direct&nbsp;manifestation of individual dissent.</p>
<p>This issue is divided into two components: building and experiencing the city. The first half&nbsp;is devoted to tracing architectural developments,&nbsp;ranging from an article addressing the disappearing city gates of Amsterdam to the architect&nbsp;Floris Alkemade’s perspective on interventions&nbsp;in city planning. In the second half, the focus&nbsp;shifts to the city-dwellers, flaneurs, and artists&nbsp;who experience and inscribe the city in various&nbsp;ways. This includes following Virginia Woolf’s&nbsp;footsteps through London, mapping the surveillance cameras in Manhattan and viewing the fate&nbsp;of churches in an increasingly secular age.</p>
<p>City transformations are never neutral processes, having political, economical, ethical and historical consequences. Instead of blindly undergoing the changes we are faced with, we can&nbsp;retrace the shifts and turns over the course of&nbsp;time. Here we try to understand just what and&nbsp;who it is that makes a city a place, and not just a&nbsp;space. [S]</p><img src="abbyy - 0003_files/abbyy - 0003-1.jpg" style="width:55pt;height:90pt;"/>
